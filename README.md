decking-example
===============

A very simple example project which uses [decking](http://decking.io), a Node.js tool to create, manage and run clusters of Docker containers.

You're probably most interested in this project's [decking.json](https://github.com/makeusabrew/decking-example/blob/master/decking.json) file which contains the relevant cluster definitions.
